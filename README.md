# Robot Modeling

Labs for the Robot Modeling and Control course from the University of Toronto. The code is verified to work with the installation of robotics toolbox. See the manual included in this repo for details on the toolbox. 

In these labs I implemented:
  - Modeling for KUKA robot arm
  - Inverse Kinematics
  - Forward Kinematics
  - Velocity Kinematics
  - Analytic and geometric Jacobians
  - Motion planning with and without obstacles
